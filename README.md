## Project Overview

The Basic CRUD Python Project is a command-line application designed to perform CRUD operations on a database of movies, actors, genres, and other related entities. This project serves as a practical example of how to implement CRUD functionality in Python.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, view, update, and delete movies, actors, genres, and more.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for interacting with the application.
- **Modular Design**: Organized code structure for easy maintenance and extension.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **SQLite**: For the database to store and manage the data.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database operations.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CristopherBuitrago/blockbuster.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd blockbuster
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

1. **Add Movies:**
